The purpose of the following work is to investigate consciousness from a biological, philosophical and computational point of view, in order to unify all the knowledge of our days in order to reach a conclusion about what makes us be (or not). Likewise, it is investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of being conscious, or simulating it.
